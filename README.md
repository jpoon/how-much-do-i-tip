# Wat

As you sip your wine following a delicious and hearty meal, the server who has helped translate their menu and offered recommendations on things to see and do while you are traveling through their city leaves you with the bill for the meal. At the sight of this small piece of paper, your eyes widen and you grow anxious. What do you write on that tip line? Will the restaurant staff be offended if I didn't tip?


# Why

Often what ends up happening is a frantic Googling of "tipping in *current country*" and a read of the top several search results to get a sense of what is expected. Instead, wouldn't it just be nice if this was all at my fingertips. This website is an attempt at that: https://jpoon.github.io/how-much-do-i-tip/.
